<h1>Best movies according to Reda</h1>

<h2>Below my top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Her</h3>
<p>I like dystopian movies and this movie was incredible in portraying a futuristic relationshop with AI</p>

<h3>The Lobster</h3>
<p>Another great movie making fun of societal norms and pressure for people to be in relationship while demonizing singles</p>

<h3>Gattaca</h3>
<p>Impressive movie digging deep into nature vs nurture, are we limited by our physics, race... or other aspects that we were born with or are we free souls that can achieve whatever we dream of</p>
